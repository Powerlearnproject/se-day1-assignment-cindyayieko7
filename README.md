Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well defined scientific principles, methods and procedures.
It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life. 
Including communication, commerce , entertainment and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs
Design- creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implentation- writing code and building the software according to design specification
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- providing ongoing supports, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- sequential approach with distinct phases eg: requirement, design, implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall
Agile - iteractive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- responsible for writting code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer- ensures software quality by design and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version controls, debugging tools and automated testing capabilties.
IDEs- eg: visual studios, eclipse
VCS- eg: Git, subversion 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical Debt
ways to overcome them; 
Effective communication
Agile methodology
Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing- testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing- testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance; helps to idenyify and fix deffects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from ai models.
Importance; making questions clear and specific so that ai understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague; tell me about cats
specific; tell me about the history of domesticated cats
it is more effective because the AI is able to answer effectvely
